# Disaster-response-
The project will aim at classifying people messages in time of a disaster to classify the importance and the relevance of the messages to disaster response organizations. The project will involve creating ETL pipeline to process messages from CSVs. Then load the data to SQLite. ML will read the SQlite database and create multioutput supervised learning model. Finally a webapp will be created to visualize the results.
